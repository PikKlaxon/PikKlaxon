- ☢️ Fun fact: A Black Stalker appeared in the Zone. 
He used to go to the camp at night and there he would 
stick his hand into the tent and say: "Have some water!" 
And if you don't let him take a drink from the flask or go outside,
he'll kill you! Once a man decided to make a joke: he quietly came out 
of the tent, put on a leather glove and went to his neighbors' tent. 
So, he begged piteously: "Water, water to drink..." 
And then a hand came out of the tent and grabbed him by the throat! 
And a husky voice says quietly: "What do you need my water for?".
